//	The USB specifications require that USB peripheral devices must never source
//	current onto the Vbus pin.  Additionally, USB peripherals should not source
//	current on D+ or D- when the host/hub is not actively powering the Vbus line.
//	When designing a self powered (as opposed to bus powered) USB peripheral
//	device, the firmware should make sure not to turn on the USB module and D+
//	or D- pull up resistor unless Vbus is actively powered.  Therefore, the
//	firmware needs some means to detect when Vbus is being powered by the host.
//	A 5V tolerant I/O pin can be connected to Vbus (through a resistor), and
// 	can be used to detect when Vbus is high (host actively powering), or low
//	(host is shut down or otherwise not supplying power).  The USB firmware
// 	can then periodically poll this I/O pin to know when it is okay to turn on
//	the USB module/D+/D- pull up resistor.  When designing a purely bus powered
//	peripheral device, it is not possible to source current on D+ or D- when the
//	host is not actively providing power on Vbus. Therefore, implementing this
//	bus sense feature is optional.  This firmware can be made to use this bus
//	sense feature by making sure "USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" has been defined in the
//	HardwareProfile.h file.

//	If the host PC sends a GetStatus (device) request, the firmware must respond
//	and let the host know if the USB peripheral device is currently bus powered
//	or self powered.  See chapter 9 in the official USB specifications for details
//	regarding this request.  If the peripheral device is capable of being both
//	self and bus powered, it should not return a hard coded value for this request.
//	Instead, firmware should check if it is currently self or bus powered, and
//	respond accordingly.  If the hardware has been configured like demonstrated
//	on the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, an I/O pin can be polled to determine the
//	currently selected power source.  On the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, "RA2"
//	is used for	this purpose.  If using this feature, make sure "USE_SELF_POWER_SENSE_IO"
//	has been defined in HardwareProfile.h, and that an appropriate I/O pin has been mapped
