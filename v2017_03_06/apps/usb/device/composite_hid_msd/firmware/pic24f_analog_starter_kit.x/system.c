    //Should verify that the voltage on Vdd/Vddcore is high enough to meet
    //the datasheet minimum voltage vs. frequency graph for the device.
    //If the microcontroller is "overclocked" (ex: by running at maximum rated
    //frequency, but then not suppling enough voltage to meet the datasheet
    //voltage vs. frequency graph), errant code execution could occur.  It is
    //therefore strongly recommended to check the voltage prior to performing a 
    //flash self erase/write unlock sequence.  If the voltage is too low to meet
    //the voltage vs. frequency graph in the datasheet, the firmware should not 
    //initiate a self erase/program operation, and instead it should either:
    //1.  Clock switch to a lower frequency that does meet the voltage/frequency graph.  Or,
    //2.  Put the microcontroller to Sleep mode.
    
    //The method used to measure Vdd and/or Vddcore will depend upon the 
    //microcontroller model and the module features available in the device, but
    //several options are available on many of the microcontrollers, ex:
    //1.  HLVD module
    //2.  WDTCON<LVDSTAT> indicator bit
    //3.  Perform ADC operation, with the VBG channel selected, using Vdd/Vss as 
    //      references to the ADC.  Then perform math operations to calculate the Vdd.
    //      On some micros, the ADC can also measure the Vddcore voltage, allowing
    //      the firmware to calculate the absolute Vddcore voltage, if it has already
    //      calculated and knows the ADC reference voltage.
    //4.  Use integrated general purpose comparator(s) to sense Vdd/Vddcore voltage
    //      is above proper threshold.
    //5.  If the micrcontroller implements a user adjustable BOR circuit, enable
    //      it and set the trip point high enough to avoid overclocking altogether.
    
    //Example pseudo code.  Exact implementation will be application specific.
    //Please implement appropriate code that best meets your application requirements.
