 * All rights reserved except as specified below. 
 *  
 * Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
 * license document, but changing it is forbidden. 
 *  
 * Preamble 
 *  
 *    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
 * to share and change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE 
 * specifically permits and encourages you to use this software, provided 
 * that you give the recipients all the rights that we gave you and make 
 * sure they can get the modifications of this software. 
 *  
 * Legal Terms 
 *  
 * 0. Definitions: 
 *    Throughout this License, "Font" means the TrueType fonts "AR PL 
 * Mingti2L Big5", "AR PL KaitiM Big5" (BIG-5 character set) and "AR PL 
 * SungtiL GB", "AR PL KaitiM GB" (GB character set) which are originally 
 * distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created 
 * through any modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, 
 * converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some 
 * characters in/from glyph table. 
 *  
 *    "PL" means "Public License". 
 *  
 *    "Copyright Holder" means whoever is named in the copyright or 
 * copyrights for the Font. 
 *  
 *    "You" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or 
 * modifying the Font. 
 *  
 *    "Freely Available" means that you have the freedom to copy or modify 
 * the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under the same 
 * conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can charge for this 
 * service. 
 *  
 * 1. Copying & Distribution 
 *    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any 
 * medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this license file 
 * (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies. 
 *  
 * 2. Modification 
 *    You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including 
 * modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font 
 * name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table, and copy 
 * and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, 
 * provided that the following conditions are met: 
 *  
 *    a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating 
 * how and when you changed that file. 
 *  
 *    b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to 
 * all third parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering 
 * access to copy the modifications from a designated place, or 
 * distributing the modifications on a medium customarily used for software 
 * interchange. 
 *  
 *    c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when 
 * run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in 
 * the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
 * appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
 * else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
 * redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the user how 
 * to view a copy of this License. 
 *  
 *    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font, and 
 * can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
 * themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those 
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore, mere 
 * aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a 
 * volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work 
 * under the scope of this License. 
 *  
 * 3. Condition Subsequent 
 *    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except 
 * as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
 * modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically 
 * retroactively void your rights under this License. However, parties who 
 * have received copies or rights from you under this License will keep 
 * their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 *  
 * 4. Acceptance 
 *    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
 * signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, 
 * sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law 
 * if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, 
 * sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate your acceptance of 
 * this License and all its terms and conditions. 
 *  
 * 5. Automatic Receipt 
 *    Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically 
 * receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or 
 * modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
 * impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
 * rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
 * by third parties to this License. 
 *  
 * 6. Contradiction 
 *    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
 * so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
 * any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
 * distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not 
 * permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive 
 * copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
 * satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
 * distribution of the Font. 
 *  
 *    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
 * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
 * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
 * circumstances. 
 *  
 * 7. NO WARRANTY 
 *    BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
 * THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * PROVIDE THE FONT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT 
 * PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR 
 * OR CORRECTION. 
 *  
 * 8. DAMAGES WAIVER 
 *    UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO 
 * EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY 
 * OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY 
 * DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY 
 * DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT (INCLUDING 
 * BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF 
 * USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR 
 * OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
