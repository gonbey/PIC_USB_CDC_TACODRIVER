  Function:
    void PingDemo(void)

  Summary:
    Demonstrates use of the ICMP (Ping) client.

  Description:
    This function implements a simple ICMP client.  The function is called
    periodically by the stack, and it checks if BUTTON0 has been pressed.
    If the button is pressed, the function sends an ICMP Echo Request (Ping)
    to a Microchip web server.  The round trip time is displayed on the UART
    when the response is received.

    This function can be used as a model for applications requiring Ping
    capabilities to check if a host is reachable.

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized.

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:
    None
